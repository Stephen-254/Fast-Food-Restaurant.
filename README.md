# Product-Landing-Page

This was my second official project. This is a responsive restaurant website.

As I was making this project, I encountered the following challenges: 

1. Making an image hover effect.
2. Dealing with CSS positioning.
3. How to revert texts in CSS Animations.
4. UI and Ux.
5. Responsive Designs.
6. DOM Manipulation.

I found this website, https://uicolors.app/create, it's great for color generation.
I was struggling with web responsiveness, I could not figure out a lot, but then, I bumped into a video by Kevin Powell about web responsiveness. Kevin talked about writing your CSS with an intrinsic approach. That means letting the browser finish your ideas and working with the default browser settings to achieve responsiveness. This solved all the questions haunting me, my perspective of achieving a responsive web was using media queries. That changed drastically.
